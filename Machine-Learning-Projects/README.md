# Analysis on Titanic Dataset using Decision Tree Algorithm

This project involves conducting an analysis on the Titanic dataset utilizing the Decision Tree algorithm. 

Through data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training, the project aims to predict survival outcomes of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various factors such as age, gender, ticket class, and embarked port. 

By employing the Decision Tree algorithm, the project seeks to create a predictive model that can accurately classify passengers into survived or deceased categories. 

Through evaluation and validation, the project aims to gain insights into the factors influencing survival rates on the Titanic and showcase the effectiveness of Decision Trees in analyzing historical data and making predictions.


# Iris DataSet KNN Multi Classification

This project involves utilizing the Iris dataset for multi-class classification using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. 

By preprocessing the dataset and splitting it into training and testing sets, the project aims to train a KNN model to classify iris flowers into one of three species based on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. 

Through hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation techniques such as cross-validation, the project seeks to optimize the performance of the KNN classifier. 

The goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the KNN algorithm in accurately classifying iris flowers and showcase its suitability for multi-class classification tasks using the well-known Iris dataset.

# QLearning Taxi

This project involves implementing reinforcement learning techniques, specifically Q-learning, to train an autonomous taxi agent in navigating a grid world environment. 

By representing the grid world as a simulated environment with various states, actions, and rewards, the project aims to teach the taxi agent to efficiently pick up and drop off passengers while navigating through the grid. 

Through iterative training episodes, the Q-learning algorithm updates the Q-values associated with state-action pairs, allowing the agent to learn the optimal policy for maximizing cumulative rewards over time. 

By evaluating the agent's performance and fine-tuning the learning parameters, the project seeks to demonstrate the effectiveness of Q-learning in training autonomous agents for complex decision-making tasks in dynamic environments.
