This project involves conducting an analysis on the Titanic dataset utilizing the Decision Tree algorithm. 

Through data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training, the project aims to predict survival outcomes of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various factors such as age, gender, ticket class, and embarked port. By employing the Decision Tree algorithm, the project seeks to create a predictive model that can accurately classify passengers into survived or deceased categories. 

Through evaluation and validation, the project aims to gain insights into the factors influencing survival rates on the Titanic and showcase the effectiveness of Decision Trees in analyzing historical data and making predictions.
