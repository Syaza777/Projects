# Composing Music For Beginners Using Genetic Algorithm

The project involves using a genetic algorithm to compose music tailored for beginner with the help from computer science and music theory. 

Musical compositions are represented in a format suitable for manipulation by the algorithm, which then generates a population of random compositions. 

Through successive generations, compositions evolve via selection, crossover, and mutation, with each iteration evaluated based on a fitness function assessing musical aspects like melody, harmony, and rhythm. 

The algorithm terminates after a set number of generations or when satisfactory compositions are achieved, providing beginner-friendly musical pieces as output, which may undergo further refinement as needed.
