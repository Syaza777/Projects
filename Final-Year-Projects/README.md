# Automobile Insurance Fraud Prediction System (AIFPS)

This project is an auto insurance fraud prediction system to identify and mitigate fraudulent activities within the realm of auto insurance claims. 

It leverages advanced data analysis techniques, machine learning algorithms, and artificial intelligence to assess the likelihood of a given insurance claim being fraudulent. 

By automating this process, insurance companies can efficiently flag suspicious claims for further investigation, mitigating financial losses due to fraudulent activities and enhancing overall risk management in the automobile insurance sector.


# Bookshop Management System

This project involves the development of a bookshop management system using the programming language C++. 

The system aims to streamline various tasks associated with running a bookshop, including inventory management, sales tracking, customer management, and possibly invoicing and reporting. 

The C++'s features, such as classes, inheritance, and file handling, the project will create a user-friendly interface for bookshop staff to efficiently perform their tasks. 

The system will likely incorporate data structures for storing and organizing information about books, customers, and transactions, ensuring smooth operation and effective management of the bookshop's operations.


# Car Recommendation System

This project involves building a Car Recommendation System utilizing neural network technology. 

It uses machine learning algorithms and neural networks, the system aims to analyze various factors such as user preferences, budget constraints, car specifications, and historical user data to provide personalized recommendations for potential car purchases. 

Through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, the system will learn patterns and correlations in the data to make accurate predictions on suitable car options for individual users. 

The goal is to enhance the car shopping experience by offering tailored suggestions, thereby assisting users in making informed decisions aligned with their preferences and requirements.
