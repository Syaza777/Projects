# Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) for Weather Forecasting

This project involves implementing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for weather forecasting. 

The historical weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation become the predictor for the LSTM-RNN model to learn patterns and dependencies in the data over time. 

Through sequential learning and memory retention capabilities of LSTM cells, the model aims to capture long-term temporal dependencies in weather patterns, enabling accurate forecasting of future weather conditions. 

By training the LSTM-RNN model on historical data and evaluating its performance on unseen data, the project seeks to demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in capturing complex temporal relationships for weather prediction tasks, potentially improving the accuracy of weather forecasts.

TensorFlow module which is the deep learning framework is used to define and build the LSTM RNN model (model deployment).
