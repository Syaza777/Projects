# Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) for Weather Forecasting

This project is a weather forecasting system to predict future weather conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, precipitation) based on historical data.

TensorFlow module which is the deep learning framework is used to define and build the LSTM RNN model (model deployment).
