# Introduction 

World energy consumption is an important feature of contemporary civilization since it supports human activities such as transportation, heating and cooling, and power generation. Energy consumption has risen in tandem with global population and economic expansion, resulting in severe environmental consequences such as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. To comprehend the magnitude of energy consumption and encourage sustainable energy practices, it is crucial to use visualization tools that aid in promoting awareness and action.

# Problem Statement

According to IEA World Energy Outlook 2022, the global population has been expected to increase by about two billion over the next two decades, and with improving standards of living, it is estimated that electricity consumption will increase 50% from 2021 to 2040. Regardless of the source of energy, demand is growing and in this time of global market the most important thing the world needs is energy and we need it in increasing quantity to support economic growth and build a better quality of life, especially in developing countries. Nevertheless, providing this energy around the globe comes with a responsibility and commitment where we need to use the resources responsibly. We have come up with this project World Energy Consumption to keep track of the energy usage in selected countries and the type of energy mainly used in that particular country because different countries use different types of energy, so itâ€™s difficult to say who uses the most. With the energy consumption data, we can monitor the high usages of energy and find alternatives to use it efficiently.

As stated by Terrapass, a social enterprise , the world energy consumption is projected to increase almost 50% from 2020 levels by 2050. As global energy demand increases, it is essential for us to understand energy data so we can take action to minimize the negative effects of energy production on our planet. The best way to reduce world energy consumption is to take personal responsibility and start to become conscious about how much energy we use. By knowing how much energy is being consumed, we can save energy to reduce pollutions and conserve natural resources, which in turn creates a healthier living environment for people everywhere. Meanwhile, efficient energy usage will help us save cost as well. 


# Objectives
1) To investigate the scale of energy consumption around the world.
2) To understand the trends of energy consumption using data visualization tools such as graph and pie chart.
3) To promote awareness and action towards sustainable energy use around the world.

# Analysis
The aim of analyzing energy consumption is to comprehend how energy is used and where it originates from in order to discover possibilities for improving efficiency, minimizing expenditure, and reducing environmental consequences. Hence, more informed and better understanding decisions about energy usage and its investments can be made by policymakers, corporations, and people.

There are several key purposes analyzing energy consumptions with the most important key which is to identify trends and patterns. To simply put, this analyzed data can be used not just to forecast future energy consumption but to identify locations where energy-saving measures might be implemented. Moreover, these data may be used to make improvements in terms of energy efficiency. The analysis of energy consumptions can help with detecting areas where energy efficiency solutions are needed.  Hence, this implementation of the solution will give impact in minimizing energy usage and lower the expenses of a country especially for the expenditure for the non renewable energy used.

Over the time, energy consumption has shown an increase in pattern steadily, driven by population growth, economic development, and urbanization. This issue has led us to the establishment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) No. 7 which is Affordable and Clean Energy by the United Nations in 2015. This goal has the purpose of ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. The aim acknowledges the significance of energy availability for economic growth, poverty reduction, and long-term development. It also recognises the importance of transitioning away from fossil fuels and towards sustainable and renewable energy sources in order to prevent climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

# Implementation
##### [Project Implementation](Implementation/Implementation.md)
Following are the steps in deploying the data visualization 

# Conclusion

With the statistics we have attained from the World Energy Consumption dataset we may now have knowledge to know which countries uses more energy and they can combat the rising issues that comes with over using the energy resources by studying energy statistics on global energy consumption patterns. Many countries are taking efforts to rely on reusable energy sources to meet their demands even as global energy demand keeps rising. 

In the near future, it is possible that this world can run fully run on reusable energy supply in the future. Until that time, it is in the best interest of humanity and all countries in the world to take actions to help minimize the impact of energy usage in our daily lives.
